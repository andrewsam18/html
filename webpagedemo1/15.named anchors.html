        <p>1.the Dalmatian is a breed of dog with a white coat marked with dark-coloured spots. Originally bred as a hunting dog,[2] it was also used as a carriage dog in its early days. The origins of this breed can be traced back to present-day Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia.[3] It is thought that early ancestors of the breed were certain breeds of pointers and a spotted Great Dane.[4] Today, it is a popular pet and many enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.
            Characteristics

            Body
            
            The Dalmatian is a muscular dog with excellent endurance and stamina.[5] When fully grown, according to the American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard, it stands from 19 to 23 inches (48 to 58 cm) tall.[6]
            Coat
            
            Dalmatian puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within 10 days; however, spots may be visible on their skin from birth. They continue to develop until the dog is around 18 months old. Spots usually range in size from 2 to 6 cm (1.25 to 2.5 in), and are most commonly black or liver (brown) on a white background. Liver is the recessive colour in dalmatians, meaning that both parents have to carry the liver gene to produce this colour of pups. If both parents are liver, then all puppies will be liver-spotted. Black spotted dogs always have black noses, and liver spotted dogs always have brown noses.[citation needed]
            
            Other colours that occur occasionally include blue (a blue-greyish colour), brindle, mosaic, orange or lemon (dark to pale yellow), or tricoloured (with black, brown and orange or lemon spots). Orange and lemon occur the most frequently, especially in America, and are dilutes of the standard colours. They are defined as orange or lemon depending on their nose colour.[citation needed]
            
            Another coloration pattern is a larger solid patch of colour, which appears anywhere on the body, but most often on the head, ears, or tail. Patches are visible at birth and are not a group of connected spots; they are identifiable by the smooth edge of the patch, and they have no interlacing white hairs in them.[7] Pure white individuals without spots also occur occasionally.[citation needed]
            
            The Dalmatian coat is usually short, fine, and dense; however, smooth-coated Dalmatians occasionally produce long-coated offspring. Long-coated Dalmatians are not accepted by the breed standard, but these individuals experience much less shedding than their smooth-coated counterparts, which shed considerably year-round. The standard variety's short, stiff hairs often weave into carpet, clothing, upholstery, and nearly any other kind of fabric and can be difficult to remove. Weekly grooming with a hound mitt or currycomb can lessen the amount of hair Dalmatians shed, although nothing can completely prevent shedding. Due to the minimal amount of oil in their coats, Dalmatians lack a dog odour and stay fairly clean relative to many other dog breeds.[8][9]
            Litter size
            
            Dalmatians usually have litters of six to nine pups.[10]

            Health

            A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.2 years for the Dalmatian compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.[11][12]
            
            In their late teens, both males and females may suffer from bone spurs and arthritic conditions. Autoimmune thyroiditis may be a relatively common condition for the breed, affecting 11.6% of dogs.[13]
            Dermatological conditions
            
            <p>The breed is predisposed the following dermatological conditions: atopic dermatitis, solar dermatosis, and squamous cell carcinoma.[14][15]
            Deafness
            
            A study in the UK found 18.4% of tested Dalmatians to be deaf in either one or both ears. This study also found no association between coat colour and deafness.[16] A Swiss study looking at 575 dogs from 33 different families found 16.5% of Dalmatians to be deaf in either one or both ears.[17] A German study of 1899 dogs from 169 different kennels found 19.6% of Dalmatians to be deaf in one or both ears. This study concluded that genes other than those responsible for colouring significantly contributed to deafness.[18] A US study found 25.7% of Dalmatians to be deaf in one or both ears. This study found that the evidence of a single gene being responsible for deafness to be unlikely.[19]
            
            Researchers now know deafness in albino and piebald animals is caused by the absence of mature melanocytes in the inner ear.[20] This may affect one or both ears.
            
            Typically, only dogs with bilateral hearing are bred, although those with unilateral hearing, and even dogs with bilateral deafness, make fine pets with appropriate training.[8] The main, and most noticeable, difference in a dog with uni hearing is that they do not have directional hearing; though the dog will be able to hear someone, they will not be able to hear the direction they are in.[clarification needed] The Dalmatian Club of America's position on deaf pups is that they should not be used for breeding, and that humane euthanasia may be considered as an "alternative to placement". The British Dalmatian Club recommends only purchasing pups who are BAER-tested, and requests all members to provide BAER testing results of their puppies so that the true deafness statistics can be looked at.[21]
            
            It has been proved that it is the inheritance of the extreme piebald gene that causes blue eyes. It is therefore frowned upon to breed from blue-eyed Dalmatians even if they are fully hearing.[3] In the UK blue eyes are considered a breed standard fault so blue-eyed Dalmatians will not be rewarded in the show ring.[22]
            Skeletal conditions</p>
            
            <p>A North American study of veterinary hospital records found that of over 9,000 Dalmatians 1.36% had hip dysplasia compared to the overall rate of 3.52%.[23]
            Hyperuricemia
            Dalmatian portrait
            
            Dalmatians, like humans, can suffer from hyperuricemia.[24] Dalmatians' livers have trouble breaking down uric acid, which can build up in the blood serum (hyperuricemia) causing gout. Uric acid can also be excreted in high concentration into the urine, causing kidney stones and bladder stones. These conditions are most likely to occur in middle-aged males. Males over ten are prone to kidney stones and should have their calcium intake reduced or be given preventive medication.[25] To reduce the risk of gout and stones, owners should carefully limit the intake of purines by avoiding giving their dogs food containing organ meats, animal byproducts, or other high-purine ingredients. Hyperuricemia in Dalmatians responds to treatment with orgotein, the veterinary formulation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase.[26]
            Dalmatian-Pointer Backcross Project
            
            Hyperuricemia in Dalmatians (as in all breeds) is inherited, but unlike other breeds, the normal gene for a uric acid transporter that allows for uric acid to enter liver cells and be subsequently broken down is not present in the breed's gene pool. Therefore, there is no possibility of eliminating hyperuricemia among pure-bred Dalmatians. The only possible solution to this problem must then be crossing Dalmatians with other breeds to reintroduce the normal uric acid transporter gene. This led to the foundation of the Dalmatian-Pointer Backcross Project, which aims to reintroduce the normal uric acid transporter gene into the Dalmatian breed. The backcross used a single English Pointer; subsequent breedings have all been to purebred Dalmatians. This project was started in 1973 by Dr. Robert Schaible. The first cross (F1) hybrids did not resemble Dalmatians very closely. The F1s were then crossed back to purebreds. This breeding produced puppies of closer resemblance to the pure Dalmatian. By the fifth generation in 1981, they resembled purebreds so much, Dr. Schaible convinced the AKC to allow two of the hybrids to be registered as purebreds. Then AKC President William F. Stifel stated, "If there is a logical, scientific way to correct genetic health problems associated with certain breed traits and still preserve the integrity of the breed standard, it is incumbent upon the American Kennel Club to lead the way."[27] The Dalmatian Club of America's (DCA) board of directors supported this decision; however, it quickly became highly controversial among the club members. A vote by DCA members opposed the registration of the hybrids, causing the AKC to ban registration to any of the dog's offspring.[28][29]
            
            At the annual general meeting of the DCA in May 2006, the backcross issue was discussed again by club members. In June of the same year, DCA members were presented with an opportunity to vote on whether to reopen the discussion of the Dalmatian Backcross Project. The results of this ballot were nearly 2:1 in favor of re-examining support of the project by the DCA. This has begun with the publication of articles presenting more information both in support of and questioning the need for this project. In July 2011, the AKC agreed to allow registration of backcrossed Dalmatians.[30]
            
            In 2010, the UK Kennel Club registered a backcrossed Dalmatian called Ch. Fiacre's First and Foremost. Several restrictions were imposed on the dog. Although the dog is at least 13 generations removed from the original Pointer cross, its F1 to F3 progeny will be marked on registration certificates with asterisks (which "indicate impure or unverified breeding",[31]) no progeny will be eligible to be exported as pedigrees for the next five years, and all have to be health tested.[32] UK Dalmatian breed clubs have objected to the decision by the Kennel Club.[33]
            
            Although LUA Dalmatians will not develop the urinary stones, they can still develop other types.[citation needed]
            The Dalmatian Heritage Project
            
            The Dalmatian Heritage Project began in 2005. The goal of the project is to preserve and improve the Dalmatian breed by breeding friendly and confident parent dogs with normal urinary metabolism and bilateral hearing. All puppies in the Heritage Project are descendants of Dr. Robert Schaible's parent line.[34]
            History
            Francesco di Cosimo II de' Medici (1614–1634) with a Dalmatian, by Justus Sustermans
            
            The FCI recognized Croatia as its country of origin, citing several historical sources.[35][36]
            
            The first known written reference to a Dalmatian dog is from 1375, when Peter, Bishop of Đakovo, mentions a hunting dog principally found in Dalmatia, with short white hair and black round spots on various parts of the body, naming the breed Canis Dalmaticus.[37] The earliest illustrations of the breed have been found in Croatia: an altar painting in Veli Lošinj dating to 1600–1630, and a fresco in Zaostrog.[35] The first definitive documented descriptions of the Dalmatian (Croatian: Dalmatinski pas, Dalmatiner, Dalmatinac) trace back to the early 18th century and the archives of the Archdiocese of Đakovo, where the dog was mentioned and described as Canis Dalmaticus in the church chronicles from 1719 by Bishop Petar Bakić and then again by church chronicles of Andreas Keczkeméty in 1739.[38] In 1771, Thomas Pennant described the breed in his book Synopsis of Quadrupeds, writing that the origin of the breed is from Dalmatia; he referred to it as Dalmatian.[38] The book by Thomas Bewick, A General History of Quadrupeds, published in 1790 refers to the breed as Dalmatian or Coach Dog.[38]
            
            During the Regency period, the Dalmatian became a status symbol and those with decorative spotting were highly prized. The breed was also used to guard the stables at night.[39]
            
            The breed had been developed and cultivated chiefly in England.[38] The first unofficial standard for the breed was introduced by Englishman Vero Shaw in 1882.[38] In 1890 with the formation of the first Dalmatian Club in England, the standard became official.[38] When the dog with the distinctive markings was first shown in England in 1862, it was said to have been used as a guard dog and companion to the nomads of Dalmatia. The breed's unique coat became popular and widely distributed over the continent of Europe beginning in 1920. Its unusual markings were often mentioned by the old writers on cynology.[40]
            Duties

            The roles of this breed are as varied as their reputed ancestors. They were used as hunting dogs, dogs of war, guarding the borders of Dalmatia.[37] To this day, the breed retains a high guarding instinct; although friendly and loyal to those the dog knows and trusts, it is often aloof with strangers and unknown dogs. Dalmatians have a strong hunting instinct and are an excellent exterminator of rats and vermin. In sporting, they have been used as bird dogs, trail hounds, retrievers, or in packs for wild boar or stag hunting. Their dramatic markings and intelligence have made them successful circus dogs throughout the years.[citation needed]
            
            Dalmatians are perhaps best known for working for firefighters for their role as firefighting apparatus escorts and firehouse mascots. Since Dalmatians and horses are very compatible, the dogs were easily trained to run in front of the carriages to help clear a path and quickly guide the horses and firefighters to the fires.[41]
            In popular culture

            Firefighting
            
            Dalmatians are associated with firefighting, particularly in the United States. In the days of horse-drawn fire engines, dogs would guard the horses, who could easily become uncomfortable at the scene of a fire.[42] Dalmatians were a popular breed for this job, due to their natural affinity to horses and history of being used as carriage dogs.[41] This role became unnecessary once horse-drawn fire engines were replaced with steam- and diesel-powered ones. Due to its history, the Dalmatian often serves as a mascot for the fire service, and is still chosen by many firefighters as a pet.[43]
            101 Dalmatians
            Further information: 101 Dalmatians (franchise)</p>
            
            The Dalmatian breed experienced a massive surge in popularity as a result of the 1956 novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians written by British author Dodie Smith, and later due to the two Walt Disney films based on the book. The Disney animated film,[44] released in 1961, later spawned a 1996 live-action remake, 101 Dalmatians, which also received a sequel, 102 Dalmatians in 2000. In 2003, Disney released 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure, the official sequel to the original 1961 film.[45][better source needed] Dalmatians were abandoned in large numbers by their original owners and left with animal shelters. As a result, Dalmatian rescue organizations sprang up to care for the unwanted dogs and find them new homes. AKC registrations of Dalmatians decreased 90% during the 2000–2010 period.[46] Two animated television series based on the franchise were also created, with the first being 101 Dalmatians: The Series (1997–1998) and the second being 101 Dalmatian Street (2019–2020).[citation needed]
            Lou Dog
            
            One famous Dalmatian in popular culture is Louie or "Lou Dog", the mascot of rock band Sublime. Adopted by singer Bradley Nowell in 1990 as a puppy, Lou Dog would become a central part of Sublime's image, often wandering the stage while the band was playing as well as appearing in the band's music videos. In addition, Nowell would frequently reference Louie in song lyrics, one example being in the band's most popular song “What I Got” ("...livin' with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane".)[citation needed]
            
            After Nowell's death, Lou Dog was cared for by the band's manager until Lou's death in 2001.[47]
            PAW Patrol
            
            The popular Canadian animated TV series PAW Patrol features a Dalmatian as one of the main characters - 'Marshall', who is a firefighter and paramedic.[48]

            <p>2.The Rottweiler (/ˈrɒtwaɪlər/, UK also /-vaɪlər/, German: [ˈʁɔtvaɪ̯lɐ] ⓘ)[1][2] is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large[3][4] or large.[5][6] The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs,[7][8] because their main use was to herd livestock[3] and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market.[7] This continued until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs, and police dogs.[9]
        History
        Rottweiler memorial in Rottweil
        
        According to the FCI Standard, the Rottweiler is considered to be one of the oldest surviving dog breeds. Its origin goes back to Roman times. These dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs. They marched over the Alps with the Roman legions, protecting the humans and driving their cattle. In the region of Rottweil, these dogs met and mixed with the native dogs in a natural crossing. The main task of the Rottweiler now became the driving and guarding of the herds of cattle and the defence of their masters and their property. This breed acquired its name from the old free city of Rottweil and was known as the "Rottweil butcher's dog". The butchers bred this type of dog purely for performance and usefulness. In due course, a first rate watch and driving dog evolved which could also be used as a draught dog.[3][10]
        
        The buildup to World War I saw a great demand for police dogs, which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs.[citation needed]
        
        The Deutscher Rottweiler-Klub (DRK, German Rottweiler Club), the first Rottweiler club in Germany, was founded on 13 January 1914, and followed by the creation of the Süddeutscher Rottweiler-Klub (SDRK, South German Rottweiler Club) on 27 April 1915 and eventually became the IRK (International Rottweiler Club). The DRK counted around 500 Rottweilers, and the SDRK 3,000 Rottweilers. The goals of the two clubs were different. The DRK aimed to produce working dogs and did not emphasise the morphology of the Rottweiler.[citation needed]
        
        The various German Rottweiler Clubs amalgamated to form the Allgemeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub (ADRK, General German Rottweiler Club) in 1921. This was officially recorded in the register of clubs and associations at the district court of Stuttgart on 27 January 1924.[9] The ADRK is recognised worldwide as the home club of the Rottweiler.[citation needed]
        
        In 1931, the Rottweiler was officially recognised by the American Kennel Club.[11] In 1936, Rottweilers were exhibited in Britain at Crufts. In 1966, a separate register was opened for the breed. In fact, in the mid-1990s, the popularity of the Rottweiler reached an all-time high, as it was the most registered dog by the American Kennel Club.[12][better source needed] In 2017, the American Kennel Club ranked the Rottweiler as the eighth-most popular purebred dog in the United States.[13]
        Description
        
        The Fédération Cynologique Internationale gives the following description of the Rottweiler standard: "Rottweiler breeders aim at a dog of abundant strength, black coated with clearly defined rich tan markings, whose powerful appearance does not lack nobility and which is exceptionally well suited to being a companion, service, rescue and working dog."[3]
        Anatomy of the Rottweiler (see left for descrip tion)
        
            Head (eyes)

            Tail
        
        Head
        
        <p>The skull is of medium length, relatively broad between the ears. The forehead line is moderately arched as seen from the side, with the occipital bone well developed without being conspicuous. The stop is relatively strong. Frontal groove not too deep.[3]
        
        The Rottweiler nose is well developed, more broad than round, with relatively large nostrils and always black. The muzzle should appear neither elongated nor shortened in relation to the cranial region. The ratio between the length of the muzzle and the length of the skull is about 1 to 1.5. The nasal bridge is straight, broad at the base and moderately tapered.[3]
        
        The lips are black and close fitting with the corner of the mouth not visible. The gums should be black, or as dark as possible. Both the upper and lower jaws are strong and broad. According to the FCI Standard Rottweilers should have strong and complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors closely overlapping the lower incisors. The zygomatic arches should be pronounced (but not exaggerated).[3]
        
        Upper and lower jaw strong and broad. Strong, complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors overlapping the lower incisors.[3] The eyes should be of medium size, almond-shaped and dark brown in colour. The eyelids are close fitting and should not droop. The ears are medium-sized, pendant, triangular, wide apart, and set high on the head. With the ears laid forward close to the head, the skull appears to be broadened. The skin on the head is tight fitting overall. When the dog is alert, the forehead may be slightly wrinkled.[3]
        
        Faults: Hound-type head. Narrow, light too short, long, coarse or excessively molossoid head; excessively broad skull, (lack of stop, too little stop or too strong stop). Very deep frontal groove. Foreface long, pointed or too short muzzle (any muzzle shorter than 40 percent of the length of the head is too short). split nose; Roman nose (convex nasal bridge) or dish-faced (concave nasal bridge); aquiline nose, pale or spotted nose (butterfly nose). Pincer bite. Molars of the underjaw not standing in one line.[3]
        
        Severe Faults: Too molossoid type and heavy general appearance.[3]
        Neck
        
        The neck is strong, of fair length, well-muscled, slightly arched, clean, free from throatiness, without excessive dewlap.[3]
        Body
        
        The back is straight, strong and firm. The loins are short, strong and deep. The croup is broad, of medium length, and slightly rounded, neither flat nor falling away. The chest is roomy, broad and deep (approximately 50% of the shoulder height) with a well-developed forechest and well sprung ribs. The flanks are not tucked up.[3]
        Tail</p>
        
        The FCI 2018 Standard states:
        
            In natural condition, strong, level in extension of the upper line; while paying attention, when excited or while moving it can be carried upward in a light curve; at ease it may be hanging. While positioned along the leg, the tail reaches approximately to the hocks or is a bit longer.[3]
        
        Historically the tail was traditionally docked at the first or second joint. However, docking is now banned in most countries and this is reflected in the FCI Country of Origin Breed Standard.[3]
        
        Although once "preferred" in early Standards, in 2018 the FCI Standard was amended to classify the Natural Bob Tail (aka "Stumpy") as a "Disqualifying Fault" along with "kink tail, ring-tail, with strong lateral deviation."[3]
        Limbs
        
        When seen from the front, the front legs are straight and not placed close to each other. The forearm, seen from the side, stands straight and vertical. The slope of the shoulder blade is about 45 degrees. The shoulders are well laid back. The upper arm is close fitting to the body. The forearm is strongly developed and muscular. Pasterns are slightly springy, strong but not steep. The front feet are round, tight and well arched, the pads hard, nails are short, black and strong.[3]
        
        When seen from behind, the rear legs are straight and not too close together. When standing free, obtuse angles are formed between the dog's upper thigh and the hip bone, the upper thigh and the lower thigh, and the lower thigh and metatarsal. The upper thigh is moderately long, broad and strongly muscled. The lower thigh is long, strongly and broadly muscled, sinewy. The hocks are sturdy, well-angulated, not steep. The hind feet are slightly longer than the front feet. Toes are strong, arched, as tight as the front feet.[3]
        Gait
        
        According to the FCI Standard:
        
            The Rottweiler is a trotting dog. In movement the back remains firm and relatively stable. Movement harmonious, steady full of energy and unrestricted, with good stride.
            However, "sluggish action while trotting" is considered a "Severe Fault".[3]
        
        According to the American Kennel Council the traditional gait of a Rottweiler is a trot. Therefore, the Rottweiler is a trotter. Trotting in this breed is by no means a fault and is required. This movement comes naturally to the Rottweiler and should appear as such; any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler's legs, both front and hind, should move in a straight forward and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the Rottweiler moves in should also be straight. The Rottweiler's gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today.[14]
        Coat
        
        The coat consists of an outer coat and an undercoat. The outer coat is of medium length, coarse, dense and flat. The undercoat should be present on the neck and thighs. The undercoat must not show through the outer coat. Rottweilers living in hot climates may have acclimatised and may be missing the undercoat. Rottweiler coats tend to be low maintenance, although they experience heavy shedding before their seasons (females) or seasonally (males). According to American Kennel Club breed standards, a Rottweiler's coat is short and straight. A coat that is long or wavy is considered a flaw to the AKC.[14]
        Colour and markings
        
        The colour and markings of a Rottweiler are very distinctive. According to the FCI Standard a Rottweiler is always "black with clearly defined markings of a rich tan on the cheeks, muzzle, throat, chest and legs, as well as over both eyes and under the base of the tail"[3]
        
        The American Kennel Club calls for mahogany or rust-colored markings that do not take up more than ten percent of the dog's body color. All Rottweilers standard to AKC specifications have one mahogany dot above each eye on the inner brow ridge, on the cheeks, one strip on each side of the snout; cheek markings do not cross over the bridge of the nose, the top of the nose should remain black. The markings on the face should move down onto the dog's throat. On the chest, a Rottweiler will have two downward-facing triangular marks. On each front leg, the marks will stretch from the forearm to the toes. On the hind legs, the markings will begin on the inside and move outward onto the stifle, then out onto the hock stretching to the toes as well. AKC standards recognize that the black base color is not completely voided on the rear pasterns. There is a patch of rust or mahogany underneath the tail that resembles a triangle as well. A thin strip of black should be present on each of the Rottweiler's toes.[14]
        Size
        
        Technically a "medium / large" breed, according to the FCI standard the Rottweiler stands 61–69 cm (24–27 in) at the withers for males, 56–63 cm (22–25 in) for females, and the weight must be between 50 and 60 kg (110 and 132 lbs) for males and 35 and 48 kg (77 and 105 lbs) for females. Weight must be relative to height.[3]
        Temperament

        One study published in 2008 found that male Rottweilers have higher confidence, sharpness, and defense and play drives than females.[15]
        
        A 2008 study surveying breed club members found that while Rottweilers were average in aggressiveness (bites or bite attempts) towards owners and other dogs, it indicated they tend to be more aggressive than average toward strangers. This aggression appears correlated with watchdog and territorial instincts.[16]
        
        In the Rottweiler Handbook, Joan H. Walker states that "The Rottweiler is very territorial", meaning that the owner will have to regularly work with the dog to control its territorial aggressiveness.[17]
        Working style

        According to the American Kennel Club,[18] Rottweilers have a natural gathering style with a strong desire to control. They generally show a loose eye and have a great amount of force while working well off the stock. They make much use of their ability to intimidate.
        
        The Rottweiler often carries the head on an even plane with the back, or carries the head up but with the neck and shoulders lowered. Some females lower the entire front end slightly when using their eyes. Males also do this when working far off the stock in an open field. This is rarely seen in males when working in confined spaces such as stock yards.[citation needed]
        
        The Rottweiler has a reasonably good natural balance, force-barks when necessary, and when working cattle uses a very intimidating charge. There is a natural change in forcefulness when herding sheep. When working cattle, it may use its body and shoulders and for this reason should be used on horned stock with caution.[citation needed]
        
        The Rottweiler, when working cattle, searches out the dominant animal and challenges it. Upon proving its control over that animal it settles back and tends to its work.[citation needed]
        
        Some growers have found that Rottweilers are especially suited to move stubborn stock that simply ignore Border Collies, Kelpies, and others. Rottweilers use their bodies to physically force the stubborn animal to do its bidding if necessary.[citation needed]
        
        When working with sheep, the Rottweiler shows a gathering/fetching style and reams directions easily. It drives sheep with ease.[citation needed]
        
        If worked on the same stock for any length of time, the Rottweiler tends to develop a bond with the stock and will become quite affectionate with them as long as they do as it directs.[19]
        
        The Rottweiler is also exceptionally suited for and is commonly used in many dog sports including Agility and Schutzhund.[citation needed]
        Health

       <p> A study in England of patient records found the average life expectancy of the Rottweiler to be 8 years, lower than the average of 12 years.[20] A survey of breed club members found the most common cause of death in the Rottweiler to be cancer, with more than 45% of deaths in the breed being attributed to cancers.[21]
        
        The Rottweiler is prone to several skin conditions these include: acral lick dermatitis, calcinosis cutis, lupoid onychodystrophy, malignant histiocytic sarcoma, systemic histiocytosis, vasculopathy, and vitiligo.[22] Follicular lipidosis is a skin condition found in red point dogs such as the Rottweiler.[23]
        
        An American study reviewing over a million cases presented to 27 veterinary teaching hospitals in North America found the Rottweiler to be prediposed to canine hip dysplasia, with 10.53% of dogs having the condition compared to 3.52% overall. This same study found the Rottweiler to also have the second highest prevalence of cranial cruciate ligament deficiency (CCLD) with 8.29% of dogs having the condition compared to an overall rate of 2.55%. For dogs diagnosed with both conditions the Rottweiler once again had the second highest prevalence with 1.34% having both hip dysplasia and CCLD compared to 0.3% overall.[24] Another American study of over a million and a quarter of a million hip and elbow evaluation records in dogs over the age of 2 years found a prevalence of 20.1% for hip dysplasia and 38.1% for elbow dysplasia, the second highest in the study.[25]
        
        One study found the Rottweiler to be prediposed to gastric dilatation volvulus.[26] However another study did not find a predisposition.[27]
        Media portrayal
        </p>
        The Rottweiler is often portrayed in media as being dangerous or aggressive.[28][29][7][30][31]
        
        Some films and television shows, such as Lethal Weapon 3, the 1998 film Half Baked, and the hit HBO show Entourage, have portrayed Rottweilers in a positive light.[32] They are also featured in the children's book series Good Dog, Carl by Alexandra Day.[33]
        
        In an event widely reported by the media, a two-year-old UK Rottweiler named Jake owned by Liz Maxted-Bluck was recognised for his bravery by the RSPCA. The dog was out walking with his owner when they heard screams. Jake chased off a man as he molested a woman on Hearsall Common, Coventry, in July 2009. He located the attacker and his victim in thick scrub, chased off the attacker, led his owner to the scene, then stood guard over the victim until the police arrived. The attacker was convicted of serious sexual assault and jailed for four years. Jake was nominated by police for the bravery award and medallion after the incident. Det. Con Clive Leftwich, from the Coventry police station, said: "From our point of view Jake the Rottweiler stopped a serious sexual assault from becoming even worse."[34]

            <dd>
            <p>3. The German Shepherd,[a] also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.
            
            It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.[4]
            History
            Max von Stephanitz, the founder of the breed (with Horand von Grafrath), circa 1900

            During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[5] Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[6] In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[6] The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.[5]
            
            To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.[6] The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;[6] some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.[7] While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.
            
            With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.[6] At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.[6] Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.[6] He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.[6]
            
            In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein.[6] Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately.[5] After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).[5] Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.[6] In just a few decades of the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.[8]
            
            Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and Württemberg.[6] Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben.[6][9] Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring.[6] This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed.[6] Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German Shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.[10]
            
            During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism.[8] German Shepherds were coveted as "germanische Urhunde", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era.[11] Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named "Prinz" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed.[12] Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'Führerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover.[11] Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result.[13] Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide.[14] German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.[15]
            
            When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog.[16] But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers.[17][18][19] The reputation of the German Shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929.[20] Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.[21]

           </p><p> The breed was named Deutscher Schäferhund, by von Stephanitz, translating to "German Shepherd Dog".[22] At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Schäferhunde, or old German herding dogs.
            
            The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word "German" would harm the breed's popularity,[23] due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.[24] The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to "Alsatian Wolf Dog",[23] after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.[6]
            
            Eventually,[when?] the appendage "wolf dog" was dropped,[23] after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality.[6] The name Alsatian remained for five decades,[23] until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds.[25] The word "Alsatian" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.[26]
            Description

            German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.[27] The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females.[28][29][30] German Shepherds can reach sprinting speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.[31] Shepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1⁄2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.[32] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[29]
            
            German Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club.[29][32][33] The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[34]
            
            Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an overall "blanket". Rarer colour variations include sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.[32]

            Intelligence
            
            German Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence.[35] In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place.[36] Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.[37]
            Temperament

            German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.[32] The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialised correctly.[38] They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.[39] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.[40]
            Aggression and biting
            Further information: Dog bite prevention
            
            A 2020 literature review in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found that from 1971 to 2018, of all pure breed dogs in the United States, the German Shepherd was responsible for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment.[41]
            
            While an Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales,[42] once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of attacks by German Shepherds drops to 38th.[43]
            
            According to the National Geographic Channel television show Dangerous Encounters, the bite of a German Shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons (238 lbf) (compared with that of a Rottweiler, over 1,180–1,460 newtons (265–328 lbf), a Pit bull, 1,050 newtons (235 lbf), a Labrador Retriever, of approximately 1,000 newtons (230 lbf), or a human, of approximately 380 newtons (86 lbf)).[44]
            Modern breed
            A common breed club's goal for German Shepherd body conformity, criticised by the UK Kennel Club
            
            The modern German Shepherd breed is criticised by experts for straying away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly.[45]: 6 [46] He believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability.[6]
            Controversy
            
            The Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed.[47][48] Some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs.
            
            The issue was raised in the BBC documentary, Pedigree Dogs Exposed, which said that critics of the breed describe it as "half dog, half frog". An orthopaedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were "not normal".
            
            The Kennel Club's position is that "this issue of soundness is not a simple difference of opinion, it is the fundamental issue of the breed's essential conformation and movement."[47] The Kennel Club has decided to retrain judges to penalise dogs with these problems.[49]
            
            The Kennel Club also recommends testing for haemophilia and hip dysplasia, other common problems with the breed.[50][51]

            White Shepherd
            
            The White Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. White-coated German Shepherds were once banned from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the coloration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white German Shepherds, calling their variety the White Shepherd. The variety is recognised as a separate breed by the United Kennel Club.[57]

                The Rajapalayam Hound, also known as the Polygar Hound or Indian Ghost Hound, is a southern Indian dog breed.[2][3][4] The breed is named after Rajapalayam, a town in the Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu.
                
                Four commemorative postage stamps were issued on 9 January 2005 by India Post for four breeds: Himalayan Sheepdog, Rampur Hound, Mudhol Hound (Face value ₹ 5 each) and Rajapalayam Hound (Face value ₹ 15). The Rajapalayam Hound is known to live up to 12 years of age.
                History
                
                In the 18th century, there are records of about 50 different dog breeds being recognized in the Indian subcontinent. One of them was this breed of dog known as Rajapalayam.[5] Historical observers believe that it was first raised during the Nayak dynasty, the main royal family of Tamil Nadu. Not only are they great watchdogs but fiercely loyal, they are also very handsome to look at. It cannot be forgotten that the villagers of the region used them in ancient times to guard the agricultural crops, livestock and agricultural produce and today it has become one of the most popular dog breeds in India.[5] It is recorded in history that during the Poligarh wars of Karnataka and Tipu Sultan from 1799 to 1805, it was used as a royal encampment and played a very important role in the battle by biting and killing horses.[5] It is also said that Tipu made a large collection of them in his hands. Today, the Indian army has realized the greatness and ability of these dogs and has trained them in the force.[5]

               <p> It is a large dog, usually measuring about 65–75 cm (25–30 inches) at the withers and weighs 30 – 45 kg. Mostly found in the centre of Tamil Nadu, the Rajapalayam was bred to be the complete hunter and estate guardian with features that allow it to excel.[1] Primarily used to hunt wild boar independent of the handler, the Rajapalayam is unique in two ways. First, it fulfills the functions of a bay dog as well as a catch dog; secondly the Rajapalayam can hunt by sight as well as track by scent. While hunting they can be relentless pursuers that are not intimidated by complex terrain or bodies of water. After finding their prey, the dogs take it down and bring it back to the handler. If the dog is unable to bring down its prey, it injures and corners the target till the handler can get to it. This dog can hunt alone, in pairs, in a pack, or with its owner.[1]
                
                Rajapalayams tend to be more muscular and heavier boned than most sighthounds, but they share the deep chest and basic body structure that exudes speed and physical ability. Its facial structure is considerably different from that of a Caravan Hound, with a slightly larger head and more powerful jaws. It has a slightly curled tail.[1]
                
                An extremely handsome and graceful dog, the Rajapalayam has a double suspension gait, similar to the trotting of a thoroughbred horse. The staple colour is milk white, although faint brown markings are quite common, and the pink nose is standard.
                
                Eye color can range from golden to brown and green.</p> Puppies born with whitish or blue eyes are usually deaf and should not be bred. The coat is single, short, and fine; these dogs don't do well in very cold climates, but excel in the heat of South India or tropics.
                
                While many Rajapalayam dogs suffer from mange, it rarely is serious, as mange is actually caused by mites, so it is basically a matter of preventing mites rather than a breed issue. Otherwise, the breed is robust and low-maintenance.
                
                Rajapalayam dogs have a pink nose, button ears, whiptail and golden eyes. They have a gait similar to that of a horse and were also used during the Carnatic Wars and Polygar war against the British cavalry. They aren't fast runners, but are tireless and steady over long distances. There were reports that the Indian Army in Kashmir had them as guard dogs.[6]
                Future of the breed
                
                The pure Rajapalayam used to only be found in isolated pockets around southern Tamil Nadu. A dog breeding unit was established at Saidapet, Chennai, during 1980–81. This unit primarily rears native breeds such as the Rajapalayam dog, Combai dog, kanni, and Chippiparai.[7] To create awareness and encourage dog lovers to rear native breeds, the Animal Husbandry Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu participates in dog shows. Localities have established a cooperative, and interested families receive female dogs and the expertise that is required for large-scale breeding. The Indian Postal Department has brought out postage stamps on the Rajapalayam dog breed,[8] as well as the Mudhol Hound, Rampur Hound, and the Himalayan Sheepdog. The Kennel Club of India has taken up the cause of the Rajapalayam. With the club's cooperation, the "Save the Rajapalayam Project" has been launched. These initiatives have successfully brought the breed back from the brink of extinction.
