<h3>Prepare the Potatoes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Wash and peel the potatoes.
Cut the potatoes into uniform strips. Aim for about 1/4-inch thickness for a balance of crispy outside and tender inside.
Soak the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes (up to several hours). This helps to remove excess starch and makes the fries crispier.
</li>
<li>Dry the Potatoes:

Drain the soaked potatoes and pat them dry thoroughly with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Any remaining moisture can cause the oil to splatter.
</li>
<li>Heat the Oil:

Pour oil into a deep fryer or a large pot, filling it about halfway.
Heat the oil to 325째F (163째C) for the first fry. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature.
</li><li>First Fry (Blanching):

Fry the potatoes in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry each batch for about 3-4 minutes until they are pale and soft but not browned.
Remove the fries with a slotted spoon or spider strainer and drain them on a baking sheet lined with paper towels.
</li><li>Increase Oil Temperature:

Increase the oil temperature to 375째F (190째C) for the second fry.
</li><li>Second Fry (Crisping):

Fry the blanched potatoes in batches again for 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown and crispy.
Remove the fries and drain them on a baking sheet lined with a wire rack. This helps to keep them crisp.
</li><li>Season and Serve:

Immediately sprinkle the hot fries with salt and any other desired seasonings.
Serve the fries hot with your favorite dipping sauces.
</li><li>Tips:
For extra crispy fries, consider frying them a third time.
You can also experiment with different types of potatoes for varying textures and flavors.
To save time, you can cut the potatoes and soak them in advance. Just make sure to dry them thoroughly before frying.
